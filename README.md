# CS491-Final-Project
This will be the repository for a Unity game, made for a Class. 

The game will consist of several areas, of different asethsetic. Hopefully we will beable to implement several abilities for the player to use to solve puzzles, which grow in difficulty as the player progresses, and help the player learn some lessons about the world in the process of having fun.

Prospectus:

We want the players to have  moments of exploration and fun solving puzzles with new abilities found throughout the game. Hopefully, it will teach the players abstract problem solving. We want the players to think about the next step up in challenge, along with the new abilities and all the uses for them.
The surprises will come out of the puzzles which we will design around the new abilities that the player collects. The whole game should be quite fun, culminating around the points where the player collects new abilities, and where a difficult puzzle/enemy is defeated.
Players will (hopefully) be curious about ways to use the new abilities, and about the puzzles that will be presented to them.
The fun had, the problem solving skills learned, and the muscle memory ingrained will be what the player learnsâ€¦ but hopefully we can teach some life lessons as well.
The story details are amorphous at this point, but we plan on communicating the story through implication, details about the abilities, and speaking to the NPC characters as well. We will use the art, animations, and the actual mechanics to contribute to the story telling.
